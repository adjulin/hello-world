Hello world test

I love c++, python and cheese!

Now let's have a look at the tartiflette recipe:
- 1 reblochon cheese (smelly)
- 1kg potaotes
- 1 cup of sauer cream
- 200g of bacon
- 1 clove of garlic

Mix all ingredients, cut the cheese in two and put on the top. Cook in the oven for 30 min. Yummy!
